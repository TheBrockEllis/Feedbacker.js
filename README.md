# Feedbacker.js

### A lean, mean feedback gathering machine

Feedbacker.js is a jQuery plugin that allows you to collect feedback from your users by adding a small icon to each screen that opens a feedback overlay. The feedback collected can then be sent to any remote script and saved/email/manipulated.

The biggest hurdle to get over with a new app is actually getting users. Once you get real, live, breathing human beings sing your product, you need to immediately start making improvements. Listen to their needs, their wants. Understand their use cases, their pain points. Ship. Listen. Revise. Rinse and repeat. Feedbacker.js helps you accomplish these goals.

## Usage

1. Include jQuery:

	```html
	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
	```

2. Include plugin's code:

	```html
	<script src="dist/jquery.feedbacker.min.js"></script>
	```

3. Call the plugin:

	```javascript
	$("#element").feedbacker({
		requireEmail: true,
        acknowledgement: "Thanks!!"
	});
	```
